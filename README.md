# WebDriverIO tests in Docker

Running [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) tests in a docker container allows you to easily add tests to your CI.

## About

1. This project uses the auto-generated sample tests from WebDriverIO's installation process
2. This is a demonstration of how we can use two containers, one for our test files and one with a browser, to run tests on our machines and/or in a CI system. 


## Running the tests

To run the tests:

1. `npm install`
2. Ensure Docker is up and running
3. Run `npm run test:docker`
